## Licensing Your Contribution 

HSLynk is published under version 2 of the Mozilla Public License. It is important that the codebase continue to be publishable under that license. To make that possible, here are some guidelines on including 3rd party code in the codebase.

If you submit code that you wrote or that you have authority to submit from your employer or institution, you give it to us under version 2 of the Mozilla Public License. If the material you submit is already licensed under a more permissive license (BSD, MIT, ISC), you can tell us that and give it to us under that license instead.

Please make the license of the code clear in your pull request. Tell us who wrote it, if that isn't just you. If the code was written for an employer, tell us that too. Tell us what license applies to the code, especially if it differs from the project's Mozilla Public License, version 2.

If you submit third-party code that doesn't come from you or your employer, and it does not contain a license statement, please tell us the license that applies to the code and provide links to whatever resources you used to find that out. For some examples, see the LICENSE and METADATA parts of Google's guide to introducing third-party code.
